- Get familiar with the open source computer vision library OpenCV using python

## Project
As part of the Visual Computing course in the summer semester 2021 at RheinMain University of Applied Sciences, I have been working on the topic of image segmentation, in particular medical image segmentation.
Image Segmentation is a computer vision task where a model takes input images and classifies each pixel. It has been a widely studied subject over the last few years, especially due the rise in Deep Learning.
I have explored different approaches to semantic image segmentation and instance image segmentation. In particular, I have concentrated on the [work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05257). It focuses on biomedical images, which are usually characterized by an excessive number of instances or complex overlaps and occlusions. Moreover, the size differences of the objects under consideration are usually less dramatic than in normal photographs. So their work was designed to deal with this challenges and uses these simplifying properties.
